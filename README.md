## How to install

### BepInEx

0. Install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) for your game.
1. Download the UnityExplorer release for BepInEx IL2CPP or Mono above.
2. Take the `UnityExplorer.BIE.___.dll` file and put it in `[GameFolder]\BepInEx\plugins\`
3. Take the `UnityExplorer\` folder (with `explorerui.bundle`) and put it in `[GameFolder]\Mods\`, so it looks like `[GameFolder]\Mods\UnityExplorer\explorerui.bundle`.
4. In IL2CPP, it is highly recommended to get the base Unity libs for the game's Unity version and put them in the `BepInEx\unhollowed\base\` folder. 

### MelonLoader

0. Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) for your game.
1. Download the UnityExplorer release for MelonLoader IL2CPP or Mono above.
2. Take the contents of the release and put it in the `[GameFolder]\Mods\` folder. It should look like `[GameFolder]\Mods\UnityExplorer.ML.___.dll` and `[GameFolder]\Mods\UnityExplorer\explorerui.bundle`.

## Mod Config

You can access the settings via the "Options" page of the main menu, or directly from the config at `Mods\UnityExplorer\config.ini` (generated after first launch).

`Main Menu Toggle` (KeyCode)
* Default: `F7`
* See [this article](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html) for a full list of all accepted KeyCodes.

`Force Unlock Mouse` (bool)
* Default: `true`
* Forces the cursor to be unlocked and visible while the UnityExplorer menu is open, and prevents anything else taking control.

`Default Page Limit` (int)
* Default: `25`
* Sets the default items per page when viewing lists or search results.
* <b>Requires a restart to take effect</b>, apart from Reflection Inspector tabs.

`Default Output Path` (string)
* Default: `Mods\UnityExplorer`
* Where output is generated to, by default (for Texture PNG saving, etc).
* Currently this is not actually used for anything, but it will be soon.

`Log Unity Debug` (bool)
* Default: `false`
* Listens for Unity `Debug.Log` messages and prints them to UnityExplorer's log.

## Building

If you'd like to build this yourself, you will need to have installed BepInEx and/or MelonLoader for at least one Unity game. If you want to build all 4 versions, you will need at least one IL2CPP and one Mono game, with BepInEx and MelonLoader installed for both.

1. Install BepInEx or MelonLoader for your game.
2. Open the `src\UnityExplorer.csproj` file in a text editor.
3. For IL2CPP builds, make sure you set `BIECppGameFolder` (for BepInEx) and/or `MLCppGameFolder` (for MelonLoader) so the project can locate the necessary references.
4. Open the `src\UnityExplorer.sln` project.
5. Select `Solution 'UnityExplorer' (1 of 1 project)` in the Solution Explorer panel, and set the <b>Active config</b> property to the version you want to build, then build it.
5. The DLLs are built to the `Release\` folder in the root of the repository.
6. If ILRepack fails or is missing, use the NuGet package manager to re-install `ILRepack.Lib.MSBuild.Task`, then re-build.

### Licensing

This project uses code from:
* (GPL) [ManlyMarco](https://github.com/ManlyMarco)'s [Runtime Unity Editor](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/RuntimeUnityEditor), which I used for some aspects of the C# Console and Auto-Complete features. The snippets I used are indicated with a comment.
* (MIT) [denikson](https://github.com/denikson) (aka Horse)'s [mcs-unity](https://github.com/denikson/mcs-unity). I commented out the `SkipVisibilityExt` constructor since it was causing an exception with the Hook it attempted in IL2CPP.
* (Apache) [InGameCodeEditor](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/ingame-code-editor-144254) was used as the base for the syntax highlighting for UnityExplorer's C# console, although it has been heavily rewritten and optimized. Used classes are in the `UnityExplorer.CSConsole.Lexer` namespace.
