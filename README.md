## How to install

Requires [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) to be installed for your game.

1. Download <b>CppExplorer.zip</b> from [Releases](https://github.com/sinaioutlander/CppExplorer/releases).
2. Unzip the file into the `Mods` folder in your game's installation directory, created by MelonLoader.
3. Make sure it's not in a sub-folder, `CppExplorer.dll` and `mcs.dll` should be directly in the `Mods\` folder.

## How to use

* Press F7 to show or hide the menu.
* Simply browse through the scene, search for objects, etc, it's pretty self-explanatory.

<i>* note: I commented out the `SkipVisibilityExt` constructor in `mcs.dll` since it was causing an exception with the Hook it attempted.</i>
